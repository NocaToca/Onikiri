# Onikiri
Onikiri is a prototype game I made for a class. It isn't completed, but I did it to learn a lot about the game development cycle and techniques. Particularly, I learned how to make real-time AI using behavior trees along with making fluid combat.

While this project isn't a complete game, it is very much a working and functional game. I really do enjoy how everything came together, and it does look really pretty!
